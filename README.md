The code in this repository was written to accompany the guide originally published [here](https://www.colby.so/posts/instant-search-with-rails-6-and-hotwire) and updated for Rails 7 on December 31, 2021.

The guide and this code base demonstrate a simple search-as-you-type interface built with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire.
